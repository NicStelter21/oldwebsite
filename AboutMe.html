         <p>
                My name is Nic Stelter and I'm a senior in high school. 
              I plan on going to Iowa State next year and studying graphic design.
              I enjoy lifting weights and spending time at my cabin. I also
              enjoy looking at the constellations on a clear night.

                    I'm a huge Chicago Bulls fan. I enjoy watching my favorite player, Lauri Markkanen,

                        <p>
                            I've been a Twins fan since I was born. My dad brought me into fandom throughout my childhood.
                            We usually make it up to a dozen games every summer (without covid).

                                    Last fall I got super into astronomy. It was kinda cool to be able to look up into the sky
                                    and recognize the patterns. I wasn't able to get too crazy with it because the weather got too
                                    cold before I had the chance to really get out and look, but I'm excited for this summer.
                                </p>

                                            I drive 2008 Pontiac G6. It was my grandma's, then my dad drove it for a while, and now it's mine.
                                            It was about 170,000 miles on it and it currently has a headlight out, so hopefully I can get that fixed sometime soon.
